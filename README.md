# 8oz Word Search (a `Flask`-full, get it?)
Here's my idea. I'm going to make a webapp that allows a user to perform a regex query against a word list to cheat at word games.

## Milestones:

1. *codename: huckster* - **complete**
    - Look, it shows words!
1. *codename: chop_shop*
    - Look, it can take text, use it as input, and return something that proves it works!
        - The main thing I'm hung up on is how the form is returned.
1. *codename: dumpster_diver*
    - Look, it can take text, parse it as a regex, and use it to search against a wordlist!

## Future Directions

1. Do more thinking for the user
    - Boggle-shaped 1-char input grid
    - Regex generator based on simple input syntax, available letters, etc.
